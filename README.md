# Pixel weather icons

This is a set of 32x32 and 16x16 pixels monochrome weather icons based on
prior work by [Dhole](https://github.com/Dhole/weather-pixel-icons).

## Formats

* `xbm` contains @Dhole's original XBM icon files.
* `png` contains PNG versions of these icons.
* `png_inv` contains inverted versions (white icon on black background).
* `png_duotone` contains duotone versions (black and red icon on white
background). This is primarily intended for use with duotone e-ink displays.
* `png_color` contains colored versions of the icons. A few colors (yellow,
blue, gray) are used as accents. The main elements of each icon are white on
a black background.

Each directory contains 16-pixel and 32-pixel versions of the icon.
